# AI Collaboration & Provenance

This repository, like all components in the `*-fred-tamlinux` suite, practices transparent AI-assisted engineering. We openly document the AI tools, models, prompts, and architectural decisions used in pair-programming this software.

---

## 1. Fred's Multi-Agent AI Toolchain

Rather than relying on a single AI model or interface, Fred uses a specialized toolchain tailored to each tool's strengths. CLI versions below were captured on 2026-09-22 and Codex was re-checked on 2026-09-23 (`<tool> --version`).

| Tool & Interface | CLI Version | Backing Models | Primary Role in the Ecosystem |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Claude Code** (`claude`) | `2.1.278` | Claude Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`) | **Architecture & System Planning**: Authoring durable system specifications, multi-step runbooks, and cross-cutting policies. |
| **Codex CLI** (`codex`) | `0.156.1` | `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra` | **Architecture & System Planning**: Second opinion on plans and specifications alongside Claude. |
| **Antigravity CLI** (`agy`) | `1.2.2` – `1.2.9` | Gemini 3.8 Flash (High) | **Coding, Refactoring & Implementation**: Primary coding partner for multi-file pair-programming, security remediation, bash/Python/QML engineering, and git release workflow. |
| **OpenCode** (`opencode`) | `1.18.31` | Big Pickle | **Distro & System Q&A**: Efficient lookups for Arch Linux / Omarchy package specifics and shell configuration, conserving frontier-model token budgets. |
| **Grok CLI** (`grok`) | `1.0.25` (`f7e67d6988e2`, stable) | Grok 4.6 | **Workstation Support**: Additional debugging, hardware diagnostics, and alternative implementation analysis. |

## 2. Provenance Standards Across `*-fred-tamlinux`

Every repository in the `*-fred-tamlinux` suite implements:
1. **Curated Session Logs**: Chronological prompt and implementation records stored as individual per-session documents in [`docs/ai/`](docs/ai/).
2. **Git Commit Trailers**:
   ```git
   Co-authored-by: Antigravity <antigravity-bot@users.noreply.github.com>
   AI-Tool: agy 1.2.6
   AI-Model: Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)
   ```
   Commits co-authored by Claude or other agents carry their corresponding GitHub identity trailers.
3. **Open Architecture Plans**: Detailed markdown specifications and security guidelines committed to version control.
4. **Private transcripts, public record**: Session transcripts are retained privately by the author, so records carry no session IDs or local transcript paths. Private details inside quoted prompts are replaced by `[redacted: …]` markers.

How to read these records and trace a line of code to its session is explained in the Tamlinux [AI provenance standard](https://github.com/greenermoose/tamlinux/blob/main/docs/ai-provenance-standard.md).
