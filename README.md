## Overview

The `tam-plugin` CLI provides a unified interface to discover, install, update, and manage plugins in the `fred.*` plugin suite for Fred's Tamlinux workstation environment. It connects directly with the official [Omarchy Plugin Marketplace](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy-plugin-marketplace) registry to verify security audit status while providing instant access to bleeding-edge releases.

### Available Plugins in the Suite

| ID | Latest Version | Description | Marketplace Status |

| `fred.clock` | `v1.3.3` | Next-event countdown badge, multi-feed iCal sync, interactive agenda, and local event management | **Listed** (security baseline passed) |

"Latest Version" is the newest GitHub release. New marketplace submissions and verification requests are paused during the Stage 1 Tamlinux transition.

Release versions last verified 2026-09-23 against each repository's GitHub Release. Run `tam-plugin list --all --refresh` for live marketplace status.

## Installation

### One-line curl installer
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenermoose/plugin-fred-tamlinux/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/greenermoose/plugin-fred-tamlinux.git ~/Code/tamlinux/plugin-fred-tamlinux
ln -s ~/Code/tamlinux/plugin-fred-tamlinux/bin/tam-plugin ~/.local/bin/tam-plugin

## CLI Usage

### 1. List Installed and Available Plugins
```bash

tam-plugin list --all

# Force refresh the marketplace registry cache
tam-plugin list --refresh
```

Example output:
```text
ID                 INSTALLED  STATE      MARKETPLACE            LATEST GITHUB / LOCAL
fred.agents        1.2.0      enabled    Not Listed             v1.1.2
fred.clock         1.3.3      enabled    Verified               v1.3.3

## Developer Workflow (Dual-Artifact Mode)

### Manual development in the published repository

`test` deploys an immutable snapshot from
`~/Code/tamlinux/<name>-fred-tamlinux`. Editing the repository afterward does not
change the running plugin until `test` is run again.

```bash
cd ~/Code/tamlinux/agents-fred-tamlinux
git switch -c manual/my-change

# Edit, inspect, and validate without affecting the running system.
$EDITOR Main.qml
git diff
git diff --check
omarchy plugin validate .

# Snapshot the current working tree and test it locally.
tam-plugin test fred.agents
tam-plugin test fred.agents status

# After more edits, deploy a new snapshot. Undo toggles between the two most
# recently tested snapshots; off restores the exact pre-test installation.
tam-plugin test fred.agents
tam-plugin test fred.agents undo
tam-plugin test fred.agents off

# A Git ref can be tested independently of uncommitted working-tree changes.
tam-plugin test fred.agents HEAD~1
```

Snapshots and their metadata live under
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/tam-plugin/test/<id>/`. The
original live plugin directory is moved there while test mode is active and
restored by `test <id> off`. Test mode refuses to replace an existing dev
symlink, and dev mode refuses to replace an active test snapshot.

### Fast editing in the deployed configuration

For the established development workflow against a local workstation
config checkout:

```bash
# Toggle fast QML development symlink override (bypasses read-only store symlinks)
tam-plugin dev fred.clock on

# Edit QML files in $FRED_CONFIG_REPO/config/omarchy/plugins/fred.clock/...
# manifest.json edits are picked up live; QML/JS edits are not: Quickshell 0.3.1
# cannot clear its in-memory component cache, and Qt's on-disk qmlcache trusts
# the source mtime (a constant 1970 for Nix store files). `dev on|off` and
# `update` purge ~/.cache/quickshell/qmlcache for the plugins and restart the
# shell; after a plain home-manager switch do the same by hand:
tam-plugin dev fred.clock off   # or: omarchy-restart-shell after purging

# Restore Home Manager store links when done. This refuses to switch while
# another plugin override remains, because Home Manager could otherwise
# replace differing files through that symlink. It also refuses while this
# plugin has uncommitted deployed-copy changes.
tam-plugin dev fred.clock off

# Diff local deployed config against public published repo
tam-plugin diff fred.clock

# Machine-checked verification comparing payload manifests (fails on drift)
tam-plugin verify fred.clock

# Reconcile overrides or recover if an operation was interrupted
tam-plugin restore fred.clock

# Transition a tested candidate to normal daily-driver Run mode (updates BOM)
tam-plugin run fred.clock
```
