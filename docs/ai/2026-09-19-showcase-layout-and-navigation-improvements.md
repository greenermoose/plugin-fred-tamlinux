# Session: 2026-09-19 — Showcase Layout & Navigation Improvements

- **Date**: 2026-09-19
- **Primary AI Agent**: Antigravity (Google DeepMind) via Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.6`)
- **AI Model**: Gemini 3.8 Flash (High) (`gemini-3.8-flash-high`)
- **Transcript**: Retained privately by the author.
- **Participants**: Fred (@greenermoose), Antigravity

## Guiding Prompts
> **Fred:**
> "Improve https://greenermoose.github.io/omarchy-fred-plugin/ as follows:
> 1) Move the Standardization Strategy section down below the cards showing the plugins.
> 2) Remove the heading Plugin Catalog. The cards showing the plugins should appear directly below the curl statement showing how to install the management script.
> 3) On viewports that are wide enough to show the whole curl command without scrolling, allow full width display. The goal is to show the whole curl command in one box with the copy chip without needing horizontal scroll, so people can see the whole thing in one glance.
> 4) Put the version number of omarchy-fred-plugin on the top line next to the GitHub link.
> 5) Add a link from the Omarchy Linux Ecosystem chip to https://github.com/greenermoose/omarchy-fred-ecosystem"

## Architectural Decisions
1. **Direct Hero-to-Cards Showcase Flow**:
   - Relocated the *Standardization Strategy* section (narrative and 3 cards: Hardware Efficiency, Unified Workflows, Tailored Desktop Suite) to sit immediately beneath the 6-plugin catalog cards.
   - Removed the `Plugin Catalog` section heading so the plugin cards sit directly beneath the installation curl command, presenting visitors with the plugins immediately upon arrival.

2. **Full-Width Hero Installation Command**:
   - Replaced the fixed inline `max-width: 620px` constraint with a responsive `.hero-install` class (`width: 100%; max-width: 100%; margin: 1.5rem auto 0;`).
   - Enabled flexible code container sizing (`flex: 1 1 auto; min-width: 0;`) on `.code-block code`.
   - On wide viewports (desktop, laptop, tablet landscape), the 99-character curl command renders across the full container width with the Copy button neatly aligned on the right, eliminating horizontal scrollbars and allowing visitors to see the entire command at a single glance. On narrow viewports (<930px), horizontal scrolling is retained to prevent layout breakage.

3. **Top-Line Version & Ecosystem Navigation**:
   - Added version badge `v1.0.1` next to the GitHub link in the top-line header actions row (`.header-right`), linking directly to repository releases.
   - Linked the `Omarchy Linux Ecosystem` badge/chip to the umbrella ecosystem repository (`https://github.com/greenermoose/omarchy-fred-ecosystem`) with custom interactive hover styling.
