- **Tool:** Antigravity CLI (`agy`) `1.2.9`
- **Model:** Gemini 3.8 Flash (High) (`gemini-3.8-flash-high`)

- **User prompt:**
  > I need screenshots of fred.agents hover and panel. Add them to the agents-fred-tamlinux and plugin-fred-tamlinux repos. I want the screenshots to show on Fred's Tamlinux Plugin Suite site (https://greenermoose.github.io/plugin-fred-tamlinux/).

## Actions Taken & Key Decisions

1. **Dual Screenshot Integration**:
   - Added authentic human-assisted captures to `docs/assets/`:
     - `assets/agents-screenshot.png`: Open panel showing Antigravity Google AI Pro tier and active meters (`538x821`).
     - `assets/agents-hover.png`: Bar hover tooltip with active robot glyph on top bar (`481x238`).
2. **Dual-Preview Component**:
   - Replaced placeholder on the `fred.agents` card with `.card-preview.dual-preview`.
   - Displays both Panel and Bar Hover views side-by-side with distinct styled badges (`Panel`, `Bar Hover`) and individual hover zoom hints.
   - Preserves standard 200px preview card height and responsive behavior down to mobile viewports (zero horizontal blowout).
   - Wired each preview item to `openLightbox(...)` so visitors can enlarge either view to full screen with one click.
3. **Verification**:
   - Rendered showcase via headless Chromium across desktop (`1400x1000`) and mobile (`400x900`) viewports. Verified responsive side-by-side presentation, tag contrast, and lightbox triggers.
