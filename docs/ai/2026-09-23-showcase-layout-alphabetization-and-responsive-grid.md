  > Fix the layout of the version and verified chips on the fred.workspaces card and take care of a few other formatting issues:
  > 1) Allow the plugin cards to be wider on screens that provide wider width. They are too crammed together on big screens. On small screens or mobile, the cards will need to stack. But on large screens, the left and right gutters on either side of the plugin cards are too big.
  > 2) Display the plugins in alphabetical order. These seem in random order and make a plugin hard to find.
  > 3) Down further on the page where the cards Hardware Longevity, etc. appear, allow four cards per row on screens that are wide enough to comfortably show four across. The 3/1 wrap is awkward and unnecessary on large viewports.

## Actions Taken & Key Decisions

1. **Wider Desktop Container & Proportional Gutters**:
   - Expanded `.container` from `max-width: 960px` to `max-width: 1400px`, reducing empty black outer margins on wide viewports (1080p, 1440p, 4K).
   - Constrained `.hero-install` command block to `max-width: 820px; margin: 1.5rem auto 0;` so it anchors comfortably beneath the lead text without excessive stretching.
2. **Alphabetical Plugin Ordering**:
   - Reordered all 8 plugin cards in `docs/index.html` strictly alphabetically by plugin ID:
     1. `fred.agents` (v1.2.0)
     2. `fred.clock` (v1.3.3, Verified)
     3. `fred.keyboard` (v1.0.0, Verified)
     4. `fred.monitor` (v1.2.3)
     5. `fred.sysinfo` (v1.1.2)
     6. `fred.tides` (v1.0.4)
     7. `fred.weather` (v1.0.4)
     8. `fred.workspaces` (v1.5.2, Update unverified)
   - Fixed `fred.agents` copy button to use the standard SVG clipboard icon consistent with the other 7 cards.
3. **Card Header & Badge Cluster Layout**:
   - Set `.badge-group` to `flex-wrap: nowrap; flex-shrink: 0; align-items: center;` so compound badges (`v1.5.2` and `Update unverified`) stay together as a single unit without splitting or dangling.
   - Updated `.card-header` with `align-items: center; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 0.75rem;` and removed `margin-bottom` on `.card-header h3` for clean vertical centering.
   - On desktop viewports, title and badge cluster sit on the same row with ample breathing room. On narrow viewports (< 420px), the entire badge cluster wraps together neatly below the title.
4. **Responsive Grid Layouts**:
   - **Plugin cards (`.grid-plugins`)**: 2 wide columns on screens `>= 840px` (~660px per card); stacks to 1 column on smaller screens and mobile.
   - **Motivation & Values cards (`.grid-values`)**: 4 across on screens `>= 1080px`, 2x2 on tablets (`640px-1079px`), and 1 column on mobile (`< 640px`). Completely eliminates the awkward 3/1 wrap.
   - **AI Collaboration cards (`.grid-ai`)**: 3 across on desktop (`>= 840px`), 1 column on smaller screens.
   - **CSS Grid bounds protection**: Used `minmax(0, 1fr)` for grid track definitions and applied `min-width: 0; max-width: 100%;` to `.card` and `.code-block` to prevent non-wrapping code text from overflowing the viewport on mobile devices.
5. **Verification**:
   - Rendered visual screenshots using `codex-render-html` across multiple resolutions: 1920x1080 (full HD), 1440x1200 (standard desktop), 900x1600 (tablet), and 390x844 (mobile). Verified zero horizontal blowout and balanced visual layout across all viewports.
6. **Frontend Learnings Recorded**:
   - Documented responsive card grid, badge cluster wrapping, and CSS Grid `minmax(0, 1fr)` lessons in persistent agent memory (`agent/memory/frontend-responsive-cards-and-badge-wrapping.md`) indexed in `MEMORY.md`.
