## Guiding Prompts
> **Fred:**
> "Update omarchy-fred-plugin to showcase the latest versions of our plugins. In the README.md, make it more obvious and prominent that we have a showcase website. On the showcase website, display the screen shots of each plugin so people can see what they look like without having to visit each GitHub repo. Ask if you have questions."
>
> "I want you to feature the showcase website first in the README file, above the property table."

## Architectural Decisions
1. **Featured Showcase Website Prominently in README**:
   - Placed a prominent callout blockquote banner with a direct link to the showcase website immediately below the title, directly above the property table.
   - Elevated the showcase website to the top property row in the metadata table for immediate discovery.
2. **Updated Suite Versions & Marketplace Verification Statuses**:
   - Synced `fred.workspaces` to `v1.5.0` (deployed `1.5.1`), noting dynamic workspace indicators, multi-monitor desktop modes (Mac, Windows, Stock), and unused monitor idle blanking.
   - Synced `fred.clock` to `v1.3.2`, updating its marketplace verification badge to `Verified` (passed official security baseline).
   - Synced `fred.sysinfo` to `v1.1.0` highlighting universal hardware telemetry, thermals, and dynamic power profiles.
   - Updated the example CLI `omarchy-fred-plugin list` output in README to reflect current versions and states.
3. **Embedded Visual Screenshots & Lightbox Viewer on Showcase Site**:
   - Staged plugin screenshots in `docs/assets/` (`workspaces-screenshot.png`, `clock-screenshot.png`, `sysinfo-screenshot.png`).
   - Integrated `.card-preview` containers on each plugin card so visitors can preview plugin UI without leaving the site or browsing each GitHub repo.
   - Created a responsive, accessible JavaScript lightbox overlay with escape key handling, backdrop click dismissal, and high-resolution original image linking.
