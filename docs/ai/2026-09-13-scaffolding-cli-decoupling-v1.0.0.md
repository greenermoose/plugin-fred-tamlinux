## Guiding Prompts
> **Fred:**
> "In /nix/store/.../AGENTS.md it says: Building or publishing a `fred.*` Omarchy shell plugin ... Let's move those conventions from the fred.clock plan to a dedicated Fred's Omarchy plugins plan. That stuff just happened to be discussed as I was building fred.clock. But now that I'm working on a larger set, we should move this sort of thing out of a specific plugin plan to the overall plan. It looks like I haven't pushed omarchy-fred-plugin yet. Can you see that project? What is the status of it?"

> "Begin work on the omarchy fred plugin ecosystem. Ask if you have questions."

## Architectural Decisions
1. **Decouple Machine-Specific Nix Paths:**
   - The initial script `~/Code/omarchy-config/bin/omarchy-fred-plugin` was tightly coupled to Fred's personal Home Manager configuration (`home-manager switch --flake ...`) and `~/Code/omarchy-config`.
   - Refactored the CLI so standard user commands (`list`, `info`, `install`, `update`, `remove`, `search`) operate against standard Omarchy directories (`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/`) using standard `omarchy plugin` subcommands with zero Nix dependencies.
   - Preserved developer mode (`dev`, `diff`) for Fred's dual-artifact workflow, auto-detecting `~/Code/omarchy-config` or using `FRED_CONFIG_REPO`.
2. **Marketplace Registry Verification:**
   - Implemented dynamic querying against `omacom/omarchy-plugin-marketplace/main/registry.json` with a 1-hour cache in `~/.cache/omarchy-fred-plugin/registry.json`.
   - Surfaces verified vs. review-in-progress status (such as `fred.workspaces` verified, `fred.clock` in review on issue #6509).
3. **Public GitHub Showcase Webpage:**
   - Created static showcase in `docs/index.html` published via GitHub Pages (`greenermoose.github.io/omarchy-fred-plugin`).
   - Explains Fred's Omarchy Linux hardware standardization strategy and details AI pair-programming methodology.
