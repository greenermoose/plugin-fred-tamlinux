## Guiding Prompts
> **Fred:**

> 
> High-performance and ergonomic desktop shell plugins
> 
> I don't want to make claims about security. Leave that to the Omarchy plugin marketplace.
> 
> Under Plugin Catalog, make the whole card clickable and linked to either the Omarchy marketplace (if the plugin is available there) or the GitHub repo. Add a button for Marketplace for plugins that have a Marketplace listing. That button should also go to the Marketplace listing (as clicking anywhere else in the card does). The GitHub Repo buttons should stay and clicking on them should take you to the GitHub repo.
> 
> Include the following badges in the cards for the Plugin Catalog:
> 
> Version
> Verified or In Review (check Omarchy plugin marketplace to determine which badget to show)
> Planned (for plugins that are not yet available but are planned)
> 
> Explain more about what omarchy-fred-plugin dev does. I would include an intro paragraph above that code snippet. List and info are self explanatory but dev needs explanation.
> 
> Verify that curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenermoose/omarchy-fred-plugin/main/install.sh | bash is the best command for installing omarchy-fred-plugin. Add an icon for copying to the clipboard next to all code snippets, as is done in chat bots and for GitHub when it shows commands.
> 
> Update the Authored by Fred line at the bottom to say "Fred (@greenermoose) and" then list all the AIs that have written code. Specify the model, e.g. Fred (@greenermoose) and Gemini 3.8 Flash.
> 
> Ask if you have any questions."

## Architectural Decisions
1. **Security Claims Decoupling**: Removed security assertions from showcase tagline, deferring validation authority to Omarchy Plugin Marketplace audits and automated security baselines.
2. **Marketplace Status & Navigation**:
   - Verified active marketplace listings for `fred.workspaces` and `fred.clock` (both approved and verified).
   - Upgraded card UX so entire cards navigate to marketplace (or GitHub repository), with explicit primary Marketplace buttons and secondary GitHub buttons.
   - Added Version, Verified, and Planned badges across the catalog.
3. **Developer Experience Documentation**:
   - Authored technical deep-dive on `omarchy-fred-plugin dev <id> on|off` explaining declarative store symlink substitution, Quickshell plugin rescan triggers, and live hot-reloading.
4. **Interactive Clipboard Utility**:
   - Integrated lightweight SVG clipboard copy buttons with visual feedback across all single-line code blocks and multi-line CLI snippets.
5. **Multi-Model Attribution**:
   - Formatted footer attribution acknowledging all AI models that contributed code across the suite: Fred (@greenermoose), Gemini 3.8 Flash, Codex (gpt-5.6-sol), and Claude Opus 5.
